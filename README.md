# Course Projects

This project contains many of my course projects as a CS bachelor from Tsinghua University.

Projects are categorized by the courses they belong to.

# Highlights

In progress

# Index

- [safety](safety/): The "Cyberspace Security" course.
  - [eke](safety/eke): Bellovin-Merritt Encrypted Key Exchange.
- [numal](numal/): The "Numerical Analysis" course.
  - The folder contains 4 jupyter notebooks, each for one problem required by the course
- [misc](misc/)
  - [SteepestDescent](misc/SteepestDescent.ipynb): Four Steepest Descent methods for optimization. It solves the problem of minimizing $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{2}x^TQx+c^Tx$. Then we plot to compare the convergence rate of four different algorithms: Steepest Descent, Accelerated Steepest Descent, Barzilai-Borwein method, and Line Search Steepest Descent. This was originally from Homework 9 of the "Mathematical Programming" course.
