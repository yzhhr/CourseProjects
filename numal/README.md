# Numerical Analysis in Spring 2024

The course requires 4 out of 7 problems from the [problems.pdf](problems.pdf) file. I completed the problems 1, 2, 3, 7 in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

You can view the rendered notebooks directly on GitHub.

# Reproduction

Install IPython and Jupyter notebook packages. Additional dependencies can be installed by running:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sympy
```
